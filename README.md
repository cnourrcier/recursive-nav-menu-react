# Recursive Nav Menu

This project implements a recursive, tree-view navigation menu for a web application using React. The menu structure is defined in a hierarchical format, supporting nested sub-menus with multiple levels.

### Key Features:

Recursive Tree-View: The menu is built to handle multiple levels of nested items, allowing for complex hierarchical navigation structures.

Dynamic Toggle: Users can expand and collapse menu items to reveal or hide sub-menus, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.

Reusable Components: The menu is constructed using modular components, including TreeView, MenuList, and MenuItem, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.

### Components:

- TreeView: The main component that initiates the menu rendering.

- MenuList: A component responsible for rendering a list of menu items.

- MenuItem: A component for individual menu items, managing the state for showing or hiding its children.
